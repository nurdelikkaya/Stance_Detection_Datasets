"Doug Terry,""There is nothing in this excellent comment with which I would want to disagree. However, I also want to add that a place with books, whether it is my house or a library, is a vital resource that brings benefits not to be found on the Internet (I am a technologist, by the way). Our local library was been closed for a couple of years for a major renovation and to save money (no good alternative was offered or created in the community). Not having a library is like losing the heart of the community. I find libraries superior to the Internet for what most people believe they get best online: random access to information and facts.

"Real Live Teacher,""Perhaps the reason more students pass online courses is the content and standards are less rigorous than in a traditional classroom. In Texas, EVERY high school class is offered as an online option -- including art, speech, science with a lab, and (wait for it) physical education!

So, do we legalize prostitution so the level of sex addiction that will always be with us becomes abundantly clear?

"M.E.,""Nick, homeschooled kids are part of society. They just don't go to public school, same as private school kids. In my state, the state athletic organization that oversees high school sports created guidelines for homeschooler participation in high school sports. They must meet academic and other requirements that enrolled kids must meet, but as long as they do, they are eligible. The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them. It's the lack of programs for the average kid after the age of 14 that's a problem.

"John R,""With an increase in insurance mergers, and the most recent Aetna/Anthem failed merger due to the FTC, there has been a substantial decrease in competition within the insurance sector. Lack of competition is bad for consumers because there are less players fighting for your business, so it is easier to raise, and keep prices high. Obamacare has also made it impossible for insurance companies to price policies based on pre-existing conditions, which is forcing actuaries to increase insurance costs across the board. Aetna has lost hundreds of millions of dollars on it's Affordable Care Act arm and is dropping the option in 11 out of the 15 states where it was offered. If insurance companies keep getting strangled by the government, there will be a sharp decrease in the participation rate of the Affordable Care Act and the Gov't may be left on the hook to provide policies (socialism) although I'm not sure what would happen if private participation drops off a cliff.

"naturegirl,""These are good points, but in our current climate they remain academic. Duty to protect statutes are a first step, but they are only as good as the individuals who enforce them. It all comes down to money. Law enforcement can be trained to assess for potential harm, but that training would cost money. Therapists are increasingly underpaid and overworked due to budget cuts. Mental health agencies could launch public awareness campaigns to teach communities about warning signs, but that costs money.

"Jim Miara,""Mr. Kornbluth asserts that CIA agents are dedicated individuals whose only goal is to serve and defend the country. That statement is as empty as a whiskey barrel at an Appalachian stomp festival. How does one serve the country?

Are you defending the country by inciting terrorist groups who use your crimes as recruiting tools? The CIA missed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It missed the 9/11 attack"; it led us into a war with Iraq by supporting false intelligence;" it missed the upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests?

"Zejee,""I teach college students. I am rated. I don't mind at all. In fact, when I was going to grad school, I checked the ratings, and even added my own rating of especially good profs.

"JaaaaayCeeeee,""I once got a summer job near the House of Seven Gables, in Salem, in the hall of records, deciphering and keying in old deed books, from the 1700's. At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life. Those who have gone through these steps learn better how to summarize, as they take notes, even if eventually on only keyboards. A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles."",students,A3698-P,students,2,4,22264,8889573,""[[""""got"""", """"summer"""", """"job"""", """"near"""", """"house"""", """"seven"""", """"gables"""", """"salem"""", """"hall"""", """"records"""", """"deciphering"""", """"keying"""", """"old"""", """"deed"""", """"books"""", """"1700"""", """"'s""""], [""""end"""", """"summer"""", """"threw"""", """"away"""", """"work"""", """"one"""", """"patience"""", """"read"""", """"ancient"""", """"cursive"""", """"copy"""", """"realized"""", """"could"""", """"instead"""", """"scan""""], [""""cursive"""", """"writing"""", """"history"""", """"far"""", """"removed"""", """"beautiful"""", """"cherished"""", """"letters""""], [""""used"""", """"underpaid"""", """"recorders"""", """"people"""", """"'s"""", """"transactions""""], [""""novelty"""", """"letter"""", """"'s"""", """"written"""", """"f"""", """"etc"""", """"wears"""", """"quickly""""], [""""however"""", """"kate"""", """"gladstone"""", """"'s"""", """"arguments"""", """"teaching"""", """"children"""", """"read"""", """"cursive"""", """"write"""", """"hybrid"""", """"takes"""", """"little"""", """"time"""", """"confer"""", """"big"""", """"benefits"""", """"later"""", """"life""""], [""""gone"""", """"steps"""", """"learn"""", """"better"""", """"summarize"""", """"take"""", """"notes"""", """"even"""", """"eventually"""", """"keyboards""""], [""""side"""", """"benefit"""", """"appreciate"""", """"cursive"""", """"history"""", """"sometimes"""", """"cradles""""]]"",""[[""""VBD"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"IN"""", """"NNP"""", """"NNP"""", """"NNPS"""", """"NNP"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBG"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"CD"""", """"POS""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBD"""", """"RB"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VB"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"VBP"""", """"VBD"""", """"MD"""", """"RB"""", """"VB""""], [""""JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"RB"""", """"VBN"""", """"JJ"""", """"VBN"""", """"NNS""""], [""""VBN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"POS"""", """"NNS""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"POS"""", """"VBN"""", """"XX"""", """"FW"""", """"VBZ"""", """"RB""""], [""""RB"""", """"NNP"""", """"NNP"""", """"POS"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBG"""", """"NNS"""", """"VB"""", """"NN"""", """"VB"""", """"JJ"""", """"VBZ"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"VB"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"RB"""", """"NN""""], [""""VBN"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBP"""", """"JJR"""", """"VB"""", """"VBP"""", """"NNS"""", """"RB"""", """"RB"""", """"NNS""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VB"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"RB"""", """"VBZ""""]]"",got summer job near house seven gables salem hall records deciphering keying old deed books 1700 's. end summer threw away work one patience read ancient cursive copy realized could instead scan. cursive writing history far removed beautiful cherished letters. used underpaid recorders people 's transactions. novelty letter 's written f etc wears quickly. however kate gladstone 's arguments teaching children read cursive write hybrid takes little time confer big benefits later life. gone steps learn better summarize take notes even eventually keyboards. side benefit appreciate cursive history sometimes cradles,""[""""medical"""", """"care""""]"",medical care,1,0";;;;

"David Michael,""I love libraries! They are a great place to just hang out and be in touch with history and knowledge of the present and past.

I actually belong to several libraries now as a full time RVer so that I can access books on my Kindle. Yes! That most remarkable Amazon device that has allowed me to build my own library with nearly 1000 mostly free books in my Kindle Fire. At age 76, I look upon this as my personal treasury, a repositary of the wisdom of the ages. In summary, I think it's great that we have physical libraries as well as devices like the Kindle that allow us to access books from anywhere on the globe with relative ease.

"Jack Robinson,""Comments are a useful and frequently informative part of online news";" they should be encouraged but much more closely monitored. For openers, commenters should be allowed only one comment per article to avoid these ubiquitous back and forth , witless arguments which often clog the comments section. Obscene, vulgar and personal attacks should be edited out, but care must be exercised. Many subjects almost demand strong comments which some may find offensive, but do not really cross the line. Some are clearly at the far left, right, or some other extreme, but often bring out ignored, but important points of view. In addition, many articles and editorials contain claims that are either wrong or at best distorted, despite usually high standards of editorial review. Comments are essential for correcting these problems. Some blogs, like Prof Juan Cole usually contain thoughtful, informed and useful information. Others seem to call forth the the worst forms of trolls, bullys, idiots and haters.

"Sarah,""The top two reasons cats are turned into shelters are house soiling and aggression (biting). It is a well-known fact that declawed cats are deprived of their main form of defense (claws), and resort to biting. Additionally, it is painful for many declawed cats to dig in a litter box. Hence, house soiling. Shelters I have volunteered at have quite a few declawed cats come in due to these reasons, declawing being the source of these issues. Pet owners who want to declaw a cat should not have a cat--period. If you want to protect your furniture, do not own a cat. Cats naturally scratch.

"Rev. Karen Tudor,""In our community, the most elegant, welcoming and practical buildings are our libraries. In the 9 years I have lived here, two libraries have been built and one redesigned and refurbished. Like the comments about the need for internet access among the poor, libraries ARE so much more. They have become a cultural, community hub for education, community activism, art, music, video and social interaction. One library has attracted the local gardening society to create and maintain a butterfly garden with many native plants that are marked for people to learn about them. Another group has offered to create a meandering walking path around the expanse of the building for reflection and a chance to walk in beauty outdoors.

"lightbulb66,""I love national parks. Growing up in India, unspoiled green spaces were really foreign, and National Parks are America's best idea for generations to come. I visit Mt Ranier National Park several times as it is almost in my backyard. I am struck by the damage that visitors can inflict on the fragile wild flower meadows in their eagerness and zeal to enjoy the beauty. While better funding and visitor resources such as mass transportation could help, something we can all do is volunteer at a NP for a few days a year. This will go a long way in relieving the already stretched NP resources and the benefit to the volunteer citizen is priceless.

"wcovenant,""The main reason educators argue against home schooling is because it works. It works so well, they have designed the system to work against the parents who chooses to become a primary educator to their own children. The legislators' should embrace the parent's decision and remove legislative road blocks that would hinder and disrespect a parent's unique role in their children's lives.

"Dan Frazier,""The Internet would be a vastly different place if we could somehow do away with anonymity. But would it actually be a better place? In our very polarized world, many people are understandably reluctant to speak out on controversial issues, unless they can do so anonymously.

Before that, people threw rocks under cover of darkness to get their point across.

"elizabeth renant,""The only solidarity the hijab shows is with that most ancient of patriarchal male control strategies, shifting the burden of morality, family and male honor, etc., onto the shoulders of female modesty. It is no different from Orthodox Jewish married women having to cover their hair, or the in the Middle Ages married women in Europe were expected to wear a coif to cover their hair, and is nakedly an attempt to confine women's sexual nature in as small a space as possible. It stands in relationship to footbinding and to female genital mutilation, albeit at another point on the bellcurve of control of women and control of female sexuality.

"Jodi Anderson,""With the costs of education FAR outpacing inflation, I wonder what these unpaid interns have to do to keep their heads above water? (Those who aren't lucky/rich enough to have parental support, that is). Of course, the price inflation of education accident. It's due to the government policy of underfunding public education. Coming from a disadvantaged background, I was simply unable afford to take on unpaid work during and after college, regardless of how much it might have helped my future career to do so. Thus I was at a disadvantage compared to peers at my college. This doesn't really sound like a level playing field, does it??? One additional point: The emphasis on internship experience on resumes allows employers an easy way to ascertain which candidates are likely to come from wealthier backgrounds...making it easier for employees to discriminate in terms of social class and race (since certain races are more likely to be represented in the disadvantaged group). Not fair. And we wonder why there are no jobs out there?

"ManhattanWilliam,""I think the concept of rating professors online (like just about any other form of public ratings) is ludicrous. To think that students attending a college where they are to be judged by a professor and given a grade for a class should be taken as fair and impartial in rating that professor's performance makes ZERO sense.

"Earthling,""According to the Centers for Disease Control, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years.

We watch reality to for entertainment that it has to offer yet is the raw that nothing can seem to conforms us. Its so contradicting with itself that it amuseses us.

"Raymond,""As an American Latino I do not at all like the separation between ' us ' and everyone else. We are one nation. Why are we so quick to say Latino families should be afforded higher education? How, in this age of political correctness, is that okay? Are we going to run around wearing Brown Pride shirts next? If white folk decided to have ' white only ' forums or ' white only ' college programs that would be labeled racist and exclusionary. We Latinos separate ourselves ENOUGH by insisting on very little to zero assimilation in our communities and on being Latin in everything we say, do, read and watch. We even teach our children to shun away from saying they are Americans like its a bad thing. College is NOT a right.

"WilliamH,""Odd for me to say this since I am (a) so deeply committed to technology and computers and type super fast (>100wpm), and (b) have really bad handwriting -- but I cannot imagine not writing in cursive. Writing in print is impossible. It is so slow as to be like using a early (not even late) generation dial-up modem.
