LBJr,"During those 3 decades of service under disparate presidents our country has bumbled into one after another military fiasco serving corporate interests more than American security. Our CIA is a terror maker... by making terrorists and by using terror tactics. I see the need for secrecy and intelligence gathering, but this offensive, off-the-books paramilitary organization combined with a totally unconstitutional intelligence gathering division is so undemocratic it makes my teeth hurt. My advice to you is to limit your exposure to Fox News, quit watching reruns of 24 and Homeland, and think about what Jesus would do.

Listen,"This is scapegoating at its best. How could it be murder if it wasn't premeditated? On top of that, this is yet another case where the person under arrest struggled with and attacked the police officer! What kind of person does that? An upstanding citizen? Obviously someone who has zero fear of authority or respect for the law. In a society where ordinary people do not fear the police or the law, you will have nothing but crime and chaos -- like in any of those 3rd world countries in Africa or Central America. The media's manipulation and exaggeration these incidents, turning each into yet another race victimhood incident rather than what it really is, another case of embolden criminal resisting arrest, will only further embolden more criminals while further tying the hands of the police.

He taught me to be like him: wake up early, work hard, eat a good meal, go to bed, repeat. He taught me that it is the responsibility of the strong to stand up for the weak, to do the right thing because it's right and not because someone is watching, to treat everyone with respect even if you loath them. He taught me how to shoot a gun, how to hunt, and the responsibilities that each of those carry with them. He raised me to be better than him, because that is the mark of a good man: leaving things better than you found them.

merlin1350,"No matter what libraries offer in the way of books, recordings, or automation, libraries are public places that are part of our commons. In a sense, loitering is allowed, people can meet, sit and think, study, and browse through a collection of books or recordings that most of us could never privately own and that can be actually borrowed for a period of time for personal use.

Charles Michener,"I've been a national critic of film, music, photography, books and cultural issues in general. I've always preferred the term ""writer about . . ."" to ""critic"" or ""reviewer"" (as in ""writer about movies or ""writer about dance""). A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few. Unlike the casual opinionators who crowd the Internet, the best professional critics become longtime companions - passionate, prickly friends with whom one can agree, laugh and argue over many shared experiences.",professional critics,A46-P,professional critics,1,1,12924,7327906,"[[""'ve"", ""national"", ""critic"", ""film"", ""music"", ""photography"", ""books"", ""cultural"", ""issues"", ""general""], [""'ve"", ""always"", ""preferred"", ""term"", ""writer""], [""critic"", ""reviewer"", ""writer"", ""movies"", ""writer"", ""dance""], [""cultural"", ""subject"", ""live"", ""performance"", ""book"", ""painting"", ""film"", ""simply"", ""complex"", ""occasion"", ""writing"", ""well"", ""something""], [""piece"", ""criticism"", ""worthwhile"", ""particular"", ""opinion"", ""entertaining"", ""provocative"", ""illuminating"", ""particular"", ""work"", ""work"", ""'s"", ""place"", ""larger"", ""historical"", ""artistic"", ""social"", ""context""], [""ultimately"", ""critic"", ""stands"", ""falls"", ""self"", ""revelation"", ""subject"", ""scrutiny"", ""much"", ""particular"", ""prejudices"", ""enthusiasms"", ""acuity"", ""work"", ""discussion""], [""professional"", ""critics"", ""crucial"", ""cultural"", ""vitality"", ""many"", ""ways"", ""champions"", ""unfamiliar"", ""works"", ""stimulators"", ""curiosity"", ""goads"", ""clearer"", ""deeper"", ""thinking"", ""artistic"", ""experience"", ""name""], [""unlike"", ""casual"", ""opinionators"", ""crowd"", ""internet"", ""best"", ""professional"", ""critics"", ""become"", ""longtime"", ""companions"", ""passionate"", ""prickly"", ""friends"", ""one"", ""agree"", ""laugh"", ""argue"", ""many"", ""shared"", ""experiences""]]","[[""VB"", ""JJ"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NNS"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""JJ""], [""VB"", ""RB"", ""VBN"", ""NN"", ""NN""], [""JJ"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NNS"", ""NN"", ""NN""], [""JJ"", ""NN"", ""JJ"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""RB"", ""JJ"", ""NN"", ""VBG"", ""RB"", ""NN""], [""NN"", ""NN"", ""JJ"", ""JJ"", ""NN"", ""JJ"", ""JJ"", ""VBG"", ""JJ"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""POS"", ""NN"", ""JJR"", ""JJ"", ""JJ"", ""JJ"", ""NN""], [""RB"", ""NN"", ""NNS"", ""VBZ"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""JJ"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""NNS"", ""NN"", ""NN"", ""NN""], [""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""JJ"", ""JJ"", ""NN"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""NNS"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""NNS"", ""NN"", ""NNS"", ""JJR"", ""JJR"", ""NN"", ""JJ"", ""NN"", ""VB""], [""IN"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""VBP"", ""NN"", ""JJS"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""VBP"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""JJ"", ""JJ"", ""NNS"", ""PRP"", ""VB"", ""VB"", ""VB"", ""JJ"", ""VBN"", ""NNS""]]",'ve national critic film music photography books cultural issues general.

Try giving out lots of Cs and see how you rate ( a grade, by the way that most students based on my experience deserve). If, as it happens, a particular prof is a terrible teacher, and a few are, word of mouth will determine the degree of success in his/her career.

J. Mark Danley,"I am always amazed at the number of people I see in a library. At the college where I teach, students pack the large computer center, use the stacks of books and study (just as I did 40 years ago) at the tables. The addition of small, private meeting rooms in our new facility allow students to congregate in study groups without disturbing others. Public libraries are also a hive of activity as people who struggle through the recession use the lending of books, movies and music to remain entertained at virtually no cost. Benjamin Franklin would be proud of this American legacy, yet so often it is the first to lose public funding.

Nathan an Expat,"A lot of the anxiety of the commentariat when it comes to the issue of online comments simply reflects the precipitous decline in deference afforded the once proud professional pontificator. They used to provide the final word. Now more often then not if they do their job right they are at best conversation starters. And what a conversation it has become, I often can't wait to get to the comments after reading an article eager to sift through the non sequiturs and sophomoric sonambulism to find the real analytical gems so often to be found there. Like the saying goes ""sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs"" ... As to trolls meh. They can be dealt with.

Paul King,"When I adopted my precious cat about 20 years ago, the women who had rescued it were thrilled that I said it would be an indoor cat. Free to roam my fenced back yard as I watched her. When I asked my veterinarian if a declaw was OK she said it would be fine from a medical, procedural and moral stand point because the after affects would be fine and the cat would not be defenseless as an indoor pet.

MR,At first the need for one person's opinion seemed unnecessary to me when we get so many for no cost but having critics is still very important in our lives; in the lives of the artist.

rockyraccoon,"I have worked in a variety of office environments since 1978. There is no question that the open office concept interferes with productivity for jobs that require concentration. I found it degrading to be put in a bullpen after having a windowless private office (which was also modular). There is nothing like shutting a door to say to people, don't bother me, I'm working. Movement and ambient noise are highly distracting. If you are visible, anyone can feel free to interrupt you.

Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken?

Rich Carrell,"Take it from a relatively new author, the present system sucks. First of all, it seems that most of the new books are by celebrity authors, many of which are just using their name to sell books and never wrote a word. Secondly, too many authors with great books are out in the cold since they cannot land a big time author. The system does not work very well for the readers.

Emily,"Mr. Stager is against ""random"" teacher assignments, as well as the artificiality of keeping to schedules. Virtually all activities, and certainly jobs, require working within schedules and learning from those more skilled or knowledgeable. He envisions a utopia where professionalism is unnecessary. ""Everyone is a teacher and learner all of the time."" I suggest the next time Mr. Stager goes to a physician he might accept that ""everyone is a doctor and a patient all of the time."" He can then be treated by a doctor, an office manager or a fellow patient. Mr. Stager may have some good ideas about integrating computer learning and traditional teachers.

DBL,"The NY Times comments are the only ones I read anymore, so I would hate for it to be discontinued. I can imagine the work involved in moderating the comments; unfortunately, I don't see a way around it anymore to keep thought-provoking, and informative dialog going. It is sad, but it is also obvious that there are more than a few people who troll various sites for issues/people that bother them so they can unleash their self-righteous intolerance and name-calling.

I thought we had just done our fair share in keeping up with our responsibilities. I don't use the library often, I'm too fond of instant gratification in book stores and too undisciplined to return books on time, but I'm convinced they are a great value in our communities and support them willingly.
