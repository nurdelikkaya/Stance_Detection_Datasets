"Tim Straus,""I read the NYT and WSJ every day and comment on both. The WSJ is a complete free for all with about 1/2 of the comments and 75% of the replies TROLL QUALITY. Despite this, I find some of the POV's quite interesting and actually broaden my perspective in that I generally do not agree, but find the points made interesting.

"DLo,""Many decades before bookstore chains like Borders and B&N, who welcomed browsers and readers with less overt pressure to buy than to spend time, we had local libraries and their branches and bookmobiles. While specialty coffees and teas were not part of the experience, a quiet spot to read, to think, to consider without pressure either to buy or move on was what library patrons most welcomed and appreciated. Perhaps one day this invaluable resource will succumb to virtual access alone: but that presents a clear disadvantage to many people for whom the local / regional / state / national library is an experience irreplacable by any virtual counterpart.

"Tideplay,The truth can be be seen by those with the will and courage to look. Although racism and prejudice is a complex social cultural learned mindset and practice it is also a practice used by the dominant group in power to maintain power.

"Nora Martin,""Having worked in the public library sector in Australia for over 20 years, I am a strong advocate of life-long learning and equity in access to information, thus I support the Open Access movement. In May 2012 I started in a fixed-term contract position at a University Library, my first foray into academic librarianship. As such, the topic of digital libraries and institutional repositories is of personal interest to me. The Open Access movement and institutional repositories have openly challenged the traditional scholarly communication system, supporting a new model for scholarly communication. Indeed, it is possible for academic libraries to alleviate the conflict between these two paradigms. Institutional repositories (by their very nature) exert pressure on journal publishers to permit as much free online access to their content as economically possible.

"Doug Terry,""There is nothing in this excellent comment with which I would want to disagree. However, I also want to add that a place with books, whether it is my house or a library, is a vital resource that brings benefits not to be found on the Internet (I am a technologist, by the way). Our local library was been closed for a couple of years for a major renovation and to save money (no good alternative was offered or created in the community). Not having a library is like losing the heart of the community. I find libraries superior to the Internet for what most people believe they get best online: random access to information and facts. Online, I don't come across things for which I am not searching. In a library, it is all there before me, waiting.

"David Naylor,""Among the many services that libraries have traditionally provided, perhaps the most important are access to physical copies of published works, and access to information. As the publishing industry transforms, not surprisingly the borrowing of physical books from libraries is likely to decline. However, the need for access to information is likely to grow. This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers. In this case the facility not only provides the access devices, but can also host tutors and local study groups. As access to steadily growing amounts of information becomes more important for all members of society perhaps the role and services of libraries might actually increase rather than decline."",libraries,A1593-P,libraries,1,1,10672,7951213,""[[""""among"""", """"many"""", """"services"""", """"libraries"""", """"traditionally"""", """"provided"""", """"perhaps"""", """"important"""", """"access"""", """"physical"""", """"copies"""", """"published"""", """"works"""", """"access"""", """"information""""], [""""publishing"""", """"industry"""", """"transforms"""", """"surprisingly"""", """"borrowing"""", """"physical"""", """"books"""", """"libraries"""", """"likely"""", """"decline""""], [""""however"""", """"need"""", """"access"""", """"information"""", """"likely"""", """"grow""""], [""""access"""", """"information"""", """"provided"""", """"devices"""", """"infrastructure"""", """"also"""", """"supported"""", """"library"""", """"staff"""", """"provide"""", """"invaluable"""", """"assistance""""], [""""assist"""", """"tools"""", """"serve"""", """"guides"""", """"navigators"""", """"around"""", """"rapidly"""", """"growing"""", """"sources"""", """"forms"""", """"online"""", """"information""""], [""""looking"""", """"future"""", """"educational"""", """"institutions"""", """"become"""", """"transformed"""", """"widespread"""", """"availability"""", """"free"""", """"online"""", """"courses"""", """"distributed"""", """"learning"""", """"becomes"""", """"norm"""", """"another"""", """"potential"""", """"role"""", """"libraries"""", """"learning"""", """"centers""""], [""""case"""", """"facility"""", """"provides"""", """"access"""", """"devices"""", """"also"""", """"host"""", """"tutors"""", """"local"""", """"study"""", """"groups""""], [""""access"""", """"steadily"""", """"growing"""", """"amounts"""", """"information"""", """"becomes"""", """"important"""", """"members"""", """"society"""", """"perhaps"""", """"role"""", """"services"""", """"libraries"""", """"might"""", """"actually"""", """"increase"""", """"rather"""", """"decline""""]]"",""[[""""IN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"RB"""", """"VBN"""", """"RB"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBN"""", """"NNS"""", """"NN"""", """"NN""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBZ"""", """"RB"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"JJ"""", """"VB""""], [""""RB"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"VB""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBN"""", """"NNS"""", """"NN"""", """"RB"""", """"VBN"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBP"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN""""], [""""VBP"""", """"NNS"""", """"VB"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"IN"""", """"RB"""", """"VBG"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN""""], [""""VBG"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBP"""", """"VBN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBZ"""", """"NN"""", """"DT"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBZ"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"RB"""", """"VB"""", """"NNS"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS""""], [""""NN"""", """"RB"""", """"VBG"""", """"NNS"""", """"NN"""", """"VBZ"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"NN"""", """"RB"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"MD"""", """"RB"""", """"VB"""", """"RB"""", """"NN""""]]"",among many services libraries traditionally provided perhaps important access physical copies published works access information. publishing industry transforms surprisingly borrowing physical books libraries likely decline. however need access information likely grow. access information provided devices infrastructure also supported library staff provide invaluable assistance. assist tools serve guides navigators around rapidly growing sources forms online information. looking future educational institutions become transformed widespread availability free online courses distributed learning becomes norm another potential role libraries learning centers. case facility provides access devices also host tutors local study groups. access steadily growing amounts information becomes important members society perhaps role services libraries might actually increase rather decline,""[""""library""""]"",library,1,1";;

"Rebecca L,""A lot of these comments criticize the use of RMP because students who don't like to do work and want to be entertained tend to like the easier professors. This is too shallow a view of RMP. RMP has extremely valuable information because people actually type in information. When you read over and over that the teacher fails to adequately explain material so that everyone is confused at test time, that's important information for a student. When you read again and again that the teacher doesn't like taking questions and instead prefers to stick to her outline, that's important information.

"Diane H,""I'm saddened that cursive is not considered important. Both my school-age boys (8th and 10th grade) have horribly illegible printing habits. They sometimes cannot read cursive. I'm more appalled to read here that SPELLING is not required in the Common Core standards! Are you serious? I'd noticed a lack of focus on spelling as my kids have gone through school, but I didn't realize that we nationally did not consider it an important skill. Spell-check isn't a good substitute, people! It is frequently wrong. And my kids seem to believe that if spell-check says something might be wrong, that it IS wrong - causing them to make more errors than they would have. (Besides, if spell-check is the reason spelling isn't crucial anymore, then why didn't we skip teaching spelling once dictionaries were invented?)

I am quoting you: """"Controlling prostitution at the level of the prostitute is like controlling drugs at the level of the junkie."""" This statement (on the GRE or LSAT) would not pass a stress test on logic, regardless of sides, as there is a missing correlation - business of prostitution similar to business of drug trafficking (missing piece). Great focus on demand! So, we get help for the junkie, indeed. All addicts need help for the addiction, including the sex junkie. So, do we legalize prostitution so the level of sex addiction that will always be with us becomes abundantly clear? No - because the consumption of women, as flesh and blood drug, is a form of cannibalism.

"MAL,""I comment reasonably frequently and also read a lot more than I would otherwise because of the comments. Mostly I feel the Times does a decent job moderating the comments, although I often notice the same pro-Hillary bias in many of the NYT picks as opposed to the Reader's Picks. (Anecdotally, this bias in the picks seems to be diminishing.) I also agree that many commenters are predictable, but because of their status, make it to the front of the line. I wonder if more courageous columnists might be willing to directly take on points that commenters raise. I feel that there is an awful lot of repetition of memes by columnists that have been discredited, such as Sanders's supposed pro-gun positions, when in fact he has a D minus rating from the NRA. Often it is commenters who bring these up, and columnists never address them.

"Passion for Peaches,""I can't speak to the ways the student vote affects national politics, but it can have a ruinous effect on the local community. The politically liberal university city I live near is dominated -- and made barely functional -- by both the votes of both current college students and the never-grow-up graduates who stick around after leaving school. Too many of the students vote for what they think sounds cool. They don't think about or care about the consequences. It's easy to vote for a new tax or bond when you aren't the ones paying for it.

"tejanarusa,""I agree wholeheartedly. It's true that I was in college a long time ago, but living in a dorm was mostly a great experience. And the parts that weren't great were good for my maturing process. As Dr. Shalala said, there's community in a dorm";" I was a shy girl, but made friends easily in the dorm atmosphere.

"Jim Miara,""Mr. Kornbluth asserts that CIA agents are dedicated individuals whose only goal is to serve and defend the country. That statement is as empty as a whiskey barrel at an Appalachian stomp festival. How does one serve the country? Do you serve the country by violating its fundamental principles with torture, even if it yields, which it didn't, helpful information? Are you defending the country by inciting terrorist groups who use your crimes as recruiting tools? The CIA missed the collapse of the Soviet Union. It missed the 9/11 attack"; it led us into a war with Iraq by supporting false intelligence;" it missed the upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Syria. In the end, it is probably true that the CIA has the interests of the country as their objective. The question is: How do they define those interests? It seems very clear their definition is consistent with the Barry Goldwater/ Neocons/Dick Cheney dictum: Excess in defense of liberty is no vice.

When I began contributing I had hoped for intelligent and meaningful discussion and debate concerning the subject.

After a few years, I removed my profiles due to the increasing belittlement and disparagement of posters who may disagree with ones opinion. These forums appear, to me, nothing more than an electronic school yard full of anonymous bullies who have little to offer to any debate or discussion.

"chuck,""For every dollar the state of So Carolina gained from video poker revenues we spent a minimum of four dollars cleaning up the mess it left behind. Some of the messes I witnessed as both a Mental Health counselor and an Addictions counselor: A client going through a $26,000 dollar inheritance in one weekend. An untold number of families whose only paycheck was blown the same day its owner was paid. An infant left in a car in July for hours by his mother while she played video poker, oblivious to the passing of time. The infant died. Two enterprising young men crowing about the $7,000 jackpot they won after putting twice that much in the machine.

"Uzi Nogueira,""It would be much easier to dismantle or close down the C.I.A. instead of reforming a humongous bureaucratic para-military-intelligence organization that has lost its basic mission statement. That is, collect and analyze material/information from foreign countries, friends or foes, and provide the political leadership with useful intelligence material to defend and protect the national security of the United States. The CIA involved in war crimes and torture comes at no surprise to any person over 40 living in Africa, Asia and Latin America. During the cold war, the agency was the main instrument of foreign policy used by the White House to destabilize unfriendly third world governments or fight proxy wars against the Soviet Union.
