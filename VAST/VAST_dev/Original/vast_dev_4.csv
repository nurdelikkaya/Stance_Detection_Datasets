"Jodi Anderson,""With the costs of education FAR outpacing inflation, I wonder what these unpaid interns have to do to keep their heads above water? (Those who aren't lucky/rich enough to have parental support, that is). Of course, the price inflation of education accident. It's due to the government policy of underfunding public education. Coming from a disadvantaged background, I was simply unable afford to take on unpaid work during and after college, regardless of how much it might have helped my future career to do so. Thus I was at a disadvantage compared to peers at my college. This doesn't really sound like a level playing field, does it??? One additional point: The emphasis on internship experience on resumes allows employers an easy way to ascertain which candidates are likely to come from wealthier backgrounds...making it easier for employees to discriminate in terms of social class and race (since certain races are more likely to be represented in the disadvantaged group). Not fair. And we wonder why there are no jobs out there?

"ManhattanWilliam,""I think the concept of rating professors online (like just about any other form of public ratings) is ludicrous. To think that students attending a college where they are to be judged by a professor and given a grade for a class should be taken as fair and impartial in rating that professor's performance makes ZERO sense. Even worse, of course, are people who go out to eat and suddenly find themselves qualified to write for Gourmet Magazine. I read these reviews occasionally but NEVER take them seriously. Still, complaining will do nothing to stop this from occurring.

Similarly, the percentage of adolescents aged 12-19 years who were obese increased from 5% to nearly 21% over the same period. Now, more than one-third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese. The obesity epidemic is linked to screen time, to kids sitting on their butts looking at screens all day, to the lack of outdoor activity and exercise. Mind and body are interactive systems and without a healthy body, there can be no healthy mind. How many yougn people these days are depressed, or hyperactive, or otherwise suffering from some mental disorder --- and how many would benefit from fresh air and exercise and time in the natural world? Mr. Bergman does not even begin to address childhood and adolescent obesity in his screed based only on personal anecdote."",teenagers,A5231-P,outdoor activities,1,2,3223,15513413,""[[""""according"""", """"centers"""", """"disease"""", """"control"""", """"childhood"""", """"obesity"""", """"doubled"""", """"children"""", """"quadrupled"""", """"adolescents"""", """"past"""", """"30"""", """"years""""], [""""percentage"""", """"children"""", """"aged"""", """"6"""", """"11"""", """"years"""", """"united"""", """"states"""", """"obese"""", """"increased"""", """"7"""", """"1980"""", """"nearly"""", """"18"""", """"2012""""], [""""similarly"""", """"percentage"""", """"adolescents"""", """"aged"""", """"12"""", """"19"""", """"years"""", """"obese"""", """"increased"""", """"5"""", """"nearly"""", """"21"""", """"period""""], [""""one"""", """"third"""", """"american"""", """"children"""", """"adolescents"""", """"overweight"""", """"obese""""], [""""obesity"""", """"epidemic"""", """"linked"""", """"screen"""", """"time"""", """"kids"""", """"sitting"""", """"butts"""", """"looking"""", """"screens"""", """"day"""", """"lack"""", """"outdoor"""", """"activity"""", """"exercise""""], [""""mind"""", """"body"""", """"interactive"""", """"systems"""", """"without"""", """"healthy"""", """"body"""", """"healthy"""", """"mind""""], [""""many"""", """"yougn"""", """"people"""", """"days"""", """"depressed"""", """"hyperactive"""", """"otherwise"""", """"suffering"""", """"mental"""", """"disorder"""", """"---"""", """"many"""", """"would"""", """"benefit"""", """"fresh"""", """"air"""", """"exercise"""", """"time"""", """"natural"""", """"world""""], [""""mr."""", """"bergman"""", """"even"""", """"begin"""", """"address"""", """"childhood"""", """"adolescent"""", """"obesity"""", """"screed"""", """"based"""", """"personal"""", """"anecdote""""]]"",""[[""""VBG"""", """"NNPS"""", """"NNP"""", """"NNP"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBN"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBN"""", """"NNS"""", """"JJ"""", """"CD"""", """"NNS""""], [""""NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBN"""", """"CD"""", """"CD"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNP"""", """"NNP"""", """"JJ"""", """"VBN"""", """"CD"""", """"CD"""", """"RB"""", """"CD"""", """"CD""""], [""""RB"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBN"""", """"CD"""", """"CD"""", """"NNS"""", """"JJ"""", """"VBN"""", """"CD"""", """"RB"""", """"CD"""", """"NN""""], [""""CD"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"JJ"""", """"JJ""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBN"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBG"""", """"NNS"""", """"VBG"""", """"NNS"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"NN""""], [""""NN"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"IN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN""""], [""""JJ"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"NNS"""", """"JJ"""", """"JJ"""", """"RB"""", """"VBG"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """":"""", """"JJ"""", """"MD"""", """"VB"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN""""], [""""NNP"""", """"NNP"""", """"RB"""", """"VB"""", """"VB"""", """"NN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN"""", """"NN"""", """"VBN"""", """"JJ"""", """"NN""""]]"",according centers disease control childhood obesity doubled children quadrupled adolescents past 30 years. percentage children aged 6 11 years united states obese increased 7 1980 nearly 18 2012. similarly percentage adolescents aged 12 19 years obese increased 5 nearly 21 period. one third american children adolescents overweight obese. obesity epidemic linked screen time kids sitting butts looking screens day lack outdoor activity exercise. mind body interactive systems without healthy body healthy mind. many yougn people days depressed hyperactive otherwise suffering mental disorder --- many would benefit fresh air exercise time natural world. mr. bergman even begin address childhood adolescent obesity screed based personal anecdote,""[""""outdoor"""", """"activity""""]"",outdoor activity,0,1";;;

"Gwenael,""What I find regrettable is that young women in their 20's would accept rules set up by old men currently holding power in the Muslim world and men who created those rules hundreds of years ago . How Pathetic that young women who should represent the future are protecting Idiotic laws from the past .

"Raymond,""As an American Latino I do not at all like the separation between ' us ' and everyone else. We are one nation. Why are we so quick to say Latino families should be afforded higher education? How, in this age of political correctness, is that okay? Are we going to run around wearing Brown Pride shirts next? If white folk decided to have ' white only ' forums or ' white only ' college programs that would be labeled racist and exclusionary. We Latinos separate ourselves ENOUGH by insisting on very little to zero assimilation in our communities and on being Latin in everything we say, do, read and watch. We even teach our children to shun away from saying they are Americans like its a bad thing. College is NOT a right.

"Glendon,""The CIA reminds me by its recent actions of the old joke, """"Military Intelligence is a contradiction in terms."""" To the extent that the CIA has become militarized and lawless, (which is the real reason that the prison at Guantanemo was established, so that torture could take place without the oversight of U.S. law) it has become a detriment to the nation, and a blot on the United States' reputation. We should disband the CIA and assign its responsibilities to civilians who will obey the laws and understand the consequences of covert actions to our foreign relations.

And younger people are paying more to reduce the age penalty as they get older, much like we do for Medicare.

"ACEkin,""I write as professor emeritus from a well-known institute of higher education. For over 4 decades I taught marketing research which is inherently involved in measurement. I know from teaching this subject and conducting research, measurement is a very complex and unforgiving process and is as good ad the instrument and its administration. As much as I believe that good measurement of performance is very valuable to faculty members, I also believe that much of this measurement is done carelessly and unscientifically. Consequently, you are more likely to see extreme results and some that do not make the intended sense at all. One of the best compliments I received from a student was in the form of what he or she must have thought to be highly critical, and I quote: """"The worst teacher I have ever had.

"Cflapjack,Back in the day I recall getting my midterm and paper back while taking the final. The prof did not give me my paper during the exam because I had done poorly and he did not want me to lose my concentration. Nice guy. When I finally got the paper from him and he told me how bad it was I had to hold my tongue because he could still have failed me. Of course if I had known I was doing poorly in the class I would have gone to his office and asked him how I could improve. Ask what I was doing wrong. He had done nothing wrong and it was common for profs to do the minimum of work.

"Johnny Comelately,""Shutting down comments sections forces discussion outside of view. It is far better and safer to know the awful truth than to have it hidden from you, to spring up some day fully formed in an unstoppable attack on our carefully tended, walled in and blindfolded world. Than is not to say that some measure of civil discourse rules should not be adopted and enforced, they should. That raises the cost of tending to the comment section, unfortunately.

"Dave,""Real names don't really help. As many other commenters have pointed out, they actually make it easier for online harassment to turn into offline harassment. What does make a difference is long-term accountability.

"Kate,""Several years ago when I was working with a Christian NGO in a largely Muslim area of Northern Kenya I asked a female colleague why she covered her head completely in the same way as Muslim women. She was surprised at my question and responded that it was a sign that she was a mature married woman. This gave me a new perspective on a symbol I had always seen as a sign of strict adherence to Islam. I later watched an interview with a young woman barber in Indonesia, where most Muslims are highly tolerant of other faiths (five are officially recognized by the government) and virtually all Muslim women wear the local style of hijab. When she was asked how she reconciled her profession with Muslim restrictions on contact with men, she replied in a matter of fact way that if she followed this rule she wouldn't be able to work and support her small daughter, and that wouldn't be good for anyone.

"NYer,""My take away lesson from these years of ACA is that we were sold a political promise that like too many was a lie. The Republicans dont have to raise their little finger for this program to fail, it will die of its own losses. Where are the number guys and what do they say about it now, the guys who were touting the program for Mr. Obama?

"Charles Michener,""I've been a national critic of film, music, photography, books and cultural issues in general. I've always preferred the term """"writer about . . ."""" to """"critic"""" or """"reviewer"""" (as in """"writer about movies or """"writer about dance""""). A cultural subject - a live performance, a book, a painting, a film - is simply a complex occasion for writing well about something. A piece of """"criticism"""" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context.

"Emmet Duncan,""In the Canadian legal system - and I suspect the American one is the same - a reasonable apprehension of bias is considered to be as pernicious as an actual bias. Indeed, the test has always been whether a party can establish the former, and not the latter. While few are so naive as to think that justices have no views, it is incomprehensible to me that a justice would enter the fray this way. It is unhelpful generally, and it is detrimental to the Court. It is unhelpful in that I doubt those who lean toward Mr. Trump place much weight on Judge Ginsburg's views to begin with - so she is unlikely to change anyone's mind (especially considering the widely-held anti-elites sentiment that has become so prominent this year). And it is detrimental to a Court that has struggled so much in recent years to combat the view that the Court is every bit as entrenched and political as the rest of the political system is.

And ask any shelter if they never see any declawed cats, and the answer will usually be the opposite. Declawed cats are abandoned regularly because of the behavior problems they develop due to pain and lacking their natural defense.

"Michael H. Ebner,""I devoted 12 years to convincing deans, presidents, and trustees -- as well as faculty colleagues -- about the virtues of upgrading our college library. I encountered much skepticism. Then again, a benefactor saw virtue, making a sumptuous gift to launch the project. Our $19-million expansion/renovation project was completed in 2004. It was planned meticulously to meet twenty-first century needs, integrating technology and print. Eight years hence the library remains a campus focal point.

The tech industry which I am familiar with, especially the financial sub-section- banking/hedge funds- that employ large numbers of software engineers, is flooded with foreign workers here on visas. By way of example, the large bank that I work for has over 200 programmers in my division, and I am the only American citizen in the group.

However there are at least two strong arguments against home-schoolers' inclusion (and against the tax payer argument) that none of the debaters brought up: 1) Private school families also pay taxes and yet may not try out for public school teams 2) Public schools only get funds based upon enrollment. Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken?

"ScottW,""""""It is hard to find any justification for the shooting of Walter Scott. . ."""" That is the understatement of the day. How about, """"There is absolutely no justification for the shooting of Walter Scott, period."""" Add to that officers lying about the murder and only being exposed because a brave citizen filmed the murder. Mr. Glennon, do you support prosecuting the officer[s] involved in the cover up for obstruction of justice? Should they also go to prison for lying and covering up the evidence? Mr. Clennon, do you support mandatory reporting of all police shootings? How can you make any claims about the use of deadly force when no police force is required to even report when a shooting takes place?

"WJH,""It strikes me that the problem is not one of architecture but of the ways in which economics drives and is used to drive development. The only thing any contemporary city knows to do is to give economic incentives to build structures that maximize tax revenues, primarily real estate taxes. Supposedly the increased revenues will be distributed as economic and social benefits. But this model has run its course. New York, for example, turning into an outlandishly expensive and impervious island of wealth. As service providers, both blue and white collar, are driven further and further from the center they find it necessary to commute inward by automobile.

They become recluses in homeless shelters. They suffer and their children suffer. Society somehow imagines the answer is making them 'unborn' because real solutions are complex, expensive and require new technologies that aren't here yet. For me the question is, """"How do we help people who are suffering, so they make better choices?"""" Good faith, means trusting others to behave altruistically";" unless they don't. When they are hurting others the issue is no longer about their rights. Children are not the possession of a cult, community or individual.

"MB,""Homeschoolers, by and large, are Christian conservatives who don't want their kids learning about godless things like global warming, evolution, and multiculturalism, and don't want their good kids corrupted by bad kids--in essence, they want to individualize education, and limit social contact with people not of their persuasion. Even if the latter is not a primary motivation, it is incident to the former. Great.

"andystac,""Earlier in the last century the theater set designer Edward Gordon Craig dreamed of the 'Ã¼ber-marionette' so that he could create a more unified stage picture. This concept has been rolling around in the back of the minds of many designers and directors since then but has never really been achievable until recently. However , for better or worse it has also become extremely easy to do, anyone who can work a mouse can pretty much do it now, no skill needed (don't let anyone tell you that this is not a fact). The effect houses are moving offshore and will soon be the the animation sweatshops in the third world.
