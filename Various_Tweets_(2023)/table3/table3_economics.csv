1	@giacomozucco Come to #Bitcoin and be humble... or be humbled!
1	@TOzgokmen The future for Bitcoin is bright 😎 Tesla has major challenges like not actually making money and falling out of favor with Biden or Xi.   There are fewer options for a CEO when a stock is falling and there doesn't look to be much resistance before $400.
1	@elonmusk @CryptoWhale We’re better off without you clown, sold the Tesla shares already!!! Bitcoin will remain independent , not even you Elon will control it.
1	@LayahHeilpern You're correct.  Let's move forward.  Nothing has changed about #bitcoin's 21 million cap, decentralization and immutability.
1	This is starting to feel like @elonmusk vs the world!!! Everyone with #Bitcoin $BTC just HOLD THE LINE!!!  https://t.co/KgoKA5Nn7K
1	@DogecoinFool @elonmusk @poisonouspinups @michael_saylor Bitcoin doesn't care. It just produces blocks. I bought more bitcoin and shorted some doge.
1	@bugrasukas Bence dxy de felaket senaryosu olucak ve bitcoin inanılmaz bir fırsat veriyor.
1	@LayahHeilpern True but what frustrates me is that the beauty of bitcoin is it’s decentralization yet this extremely wealthy individual seems to have a lot of influence over market psychology - however, this too shall pass
1	Everyone wants a #bitcoin No one wants a shitcoin. @APompliano  #elonmuskstoptalking
1	Price at which Bitcoin will find strong support #BTC #Bitcoin #bitcoin2021
1	Buying the dip with #Bitcoin
1	This is people's market,  Not the market of one person.  Don't let anyone "anyone" manipulate this market. Just understand #bitcoin is the FATHER of #crypto and always will be.. Because of it this whole market stands.. This is not a competition that which coin is best.  #hodl
1	@BitcoinTina @CaitlinLong_ Long term ... showing the World Bitcoin is Elon (or similar) resistant will be great.
1	@TheMoonCarl @elonmusk Tesla is propped up with government money. Bitcoin preceded and will succeed all the Elons out there. Buy the dip, let’s take a long stance, and scrape him off our shoes. His car is a impractical at best. Ignore him.
1	@mansi_lukka @pratik0310 @elonmusk Long live bitcoin #bitcoinisking
1	@vexty @DocumentingBTC @lexfridman @elonmusk Not why #Bitcoin is the hope. #Bitcoin is the hope because even richest most influencital entities can’t change the rules. Look at how much backlash @elonmusk is getting for meddling in the space instead of playing by the rules. #Bitcoin protects the smallest against the biggest
1	Bitcoin is too big to follow Elon musk tweets
1	Ok so Bitcoin has a bit of a flu called Elon. It’s alright, Bitcoin will get over it.
1	Can’t fuck with you @elonmusk anymore.... I’m selling my Tesla to buy #bitcoin #BTC #btc
1	@sadiaslayy Bitcoin is a necessity, without it the market is failing.
1	@JunkoSu22993224 #boycotttesla So good to see a community strong like the Bitcoin family, all united.
1	I will repeat it once more  With #bitcoin you acquire the passport for tomorrow's future, you don't exchange for cars
1	@lexfridman @elonmusk #bitcoin IS the real world. Twitter is NOT
1	@APompliano The best choice I've made this year was investing in cryptocurrency and forex trading and earning from home. $5k weekly I've never  regretted this decision. 🙏🏻🙏🏻 #Bitcoin investment is the best decision to make. Send a dm for more info.
1	Buy as much as you can Elon’s bitcoin! $btc $ada $xrp $xlm #hodlyourcoins #bitcoin @elonmusk
1	@WClementeIII Bitcoin was here long before them and will be here with or without them.   At the end of the day Tesla needs Bitcoin, Bitcoin doesn’t need Tesla.  https://t.co/cuOGQ06zjw
1	Once the FUD bucket is empty #Bitcoin will rise again.   It's inevitable.  #BTC #Crypto  https://t.co/E246mpcBur
1	#Bitcoin will rise with or without you @HSBC don't cry!  https://t.co/jiVynNlC4b
1	@tyler Once #bitcoin becomes widely regarded as an asset class around the world, there's no doubt in my mind that it will rise like a phoenix above a million dollars and that will be just the start. All this within our lifetimes, it's a miracle 💎
1	In the end you only lose money in an active bull market when you sell in a huge drawdown like we have across the board right now.....  #Bitcoin will rise above, alts will follow and strong hands will prevail... #Hodl
1	#Bitcoin is our only hope in a world full of counterfeit #fiat printing and a dystopian worldview pushed by the elites (@wef).   Stay humble. B thankful. Widen your time horizon.   #Bitcoin will rise like a Phoenix.
1	There are times where #Bitcoin gets weak but doesn't die. Such times are necessary for a healthy lifestyle for #BTC as its immune system fights greed virus flushing out all incompatible substances to its ecosystem. Make no mistake #Bitcoin will rise again, matter of when not if!
1	@PeterMcCormack Bitcoin is all about self accountability and that’s what really builds a strong asset if stored value . Fuck China and fuck Elon musk ! Once they see Bitcoin rise again they will be fomo !
1	@APompliano Bitcoin will rise again, it has always done so. The only question is whether it will do so in 1 week, 1 month or 1-3 years. But is will surely rise again, no doubt about that!
1	Very true I would buy and keep the BITCOIN, this is if a temporary situation, soon it will begin to stabilize and it will rise again with much more force to $100k  #HODL #LATOKEN  #PRCH
1	@CryptoCobain Both ALTs &amp; Bitcoin will soon rise from the ashes like a phoenix
1	china has banned bitcoin, but will rise again when everyone else realizes that bincoint is unstoppable. @EZRACAPITAL @SimonYuSEA
1	#Bitcoin will still rise let me buy the dip.  Heaven's ::  https://t.co/Mu6dtKPeOG
1	@danheld Bitcoin will rise again like a Phoenix bird.
1	Crypto holders, we’ve come too far to give up at this point. Do not let some “foreign government” discourages you from owning the future. All crypto will rise up again and there’s no government can stop it. That’s the fact! #dogecoin #bitcoin #ethereum #ShibaCoin #safemoon
1	#bitcoin  will rise strongly, soon ; this is just a giving chance before it gets high too much. (not an inv. Advice) 🍀
1	@tonevays Don’t worry hodlers…Elon Musk will soon tweet a dick emoji 🍆 which will trigger a sharp rise in #bitcoin price
1	@RAFAELA_RIGO_ Hold it up  #Bitcoin  will rise soon🔥🔥✌️🙂
1	Today crptocurrency market will up little bit specially the top most 3 powerful coin like bitcoin ,ethereum,  cardano will rise.... #Bitcoin #Ethereum #CardanoADA #cryptocurrency #altcoin
1	Bitcoin will continue to crash but it will rise even more😁😁😁
1	Bitcoin’s supply is written in code never to be tampered with.  I’m so bullish on bitcoin because it is a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy.    The more people that believe in it... the more the price will rise.
1	I know #Bitcoin will rise again. Only thing the recent dip did was create divide between believers and non-believers. In a way it is good because it weeds out the people who are here only to make short profits and don't really believe in the idea of crypto. #BitcoinCrash
1	Inevitably, cryptocurrency value based on speculation will fade away, and projects focusing on real-world adoption and utility will rise. @Dashpay  is working hard laying the groundwork for this day.  Full video:  https://t.co/3ML46WkQXA  #dash #bitcoin #altcoins #crypto #defi  https://t.co/wCYylDsnZH
1	China “cracking down” on Bitcoin mining is actually a good thing.... harder to acquire the coins almost like a “halving”. Simple supply vs demand, #Bitcoin will rise again
1	Bitcoin continues to rise ✨😍✨ When it falls, you have a chance to buy 😃✌️😁 It will reach $ 1000 by the end of the year‼  ️America First ❤️🌟🎉
1	Millions upon millions of stable coins are deposited on the exchanges. I think a massive pump is imminent. #bitcoin #crypto
0	@MassiDL273 @Sephi08273175 @elonmusk La dominance di #bitcoin è sempre meno, potrebbe non verificarsi
0	@notgrubles Once i seen Rich Dad talking about Bitcoin, i knew there was a problem.
0	So bitcoin - the currency created to give people independence from centralized institutions - is still selling off because a billionaire CEO said he’s not down with it. Maybe Bitcoin isn’t the way? Just thinking out loud
0	might want to remove the #Bitcoin laser eyes thing
0	🤣🤣🤣 elon told you #bitcoin sucks and everyone acting like it's a surprise lol
0	I think he’s going balls deep in doge now. Dumped that old trash Bitcoin
0	@DocumentingBTC And Bitcoin is not the real bitcoin anymore, BitcoinSV is...
0	@jeff_criddle @RooneyB21 I can't honestly back something that has so much cold supply just waiting to be dumped.   My cousin's hs buddy got busted years ago for selling cocaine online in exchange for bitcoin. 10mil in bitcoin,  untouchable because it was in cold storage with 2013 prices  1/
0	@Tesla @elonmusk Do something  for bitcoin, otherwise it will destroy  many of us😢😢😢 Please
0	@jasondebolt Use cases of Bitcoin are heavily limited. Other blockchains are rising fast because of conservative approach of Bitcoin community.
0	Elon 🍆 Bitcoin #ElonMusk #Bitcoin
0	Man, people really butthurt over elon and bitcon. if you're so afraid of your portfolio tanking, sell your bitcoin and cash out. #Bitcoin
0	@TaurosCrypto @b_buzzkill @heisensperg1 @jebus911 We have to take them in account yes. I would rather have 200millis parked in see shells than bitcoin at this point and i am not even joking. I want to see bitcoin rise when rates rise. If that happens I will admit I was wrong and become maxi. Fair enough?
0	@elonmusk The recent collapse in the cryptocurrency market showed that; Bitcoin now lost its power. From now on, other cryptocurrencies will continue to rise independently from Bitcoin and on the contrary. #SHIBA, #Dogecoin and other
