1	What about in cases of rape #SemST
1	Only one can have bodily autonomy #SemST
1	Antis don't care because the only people the laws are hurting are females and they don't care about things that don't effect men #SemST
1	Like 96% of antis don't care about breathing viable persons, and 100% care about embryos more #SemST
1	Anti choice laws are sexist because they ignore the fact that men abandon their pregnant partners & those men face no punishment #SemST
