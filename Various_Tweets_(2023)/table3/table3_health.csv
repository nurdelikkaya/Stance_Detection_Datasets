1	Rando (one year ago): Chris, there’s a miracle cure to end COVID.  It’s called HCQ.   Me (one year ago): Doesn’t do what you say it’ll do.   Me (today): There’s a miracle cure to end COViD.  It’s called a vaccine.    Rando (today): But what do we really know about them?   Me: 😒
1	@ZJemptv measles is probably the most transmissible human disease ever. a kid w measles used to infect 10-20 other kids before vaccines. the covid variants are still an order of magnitude (or two) less contagious than measles. but there's your upper limit.
1	Yeah, those COVID Vaccines are a real magic bullet, aren't they? #COVIDVaccination #covid    https://t.co/SC7WqP7c91
1	@Flufball_ That's good! Have you managed to keep yourself covid free? I've been lucky I took part in one of the vaccine trial and was vaccinated early on and have been ok but it's been horrible for a lot of people!
1	Get your Vaccine 💉  Get Tested for Covid 🦠 Save summer 🌺🌸🌼🌻 #savesummer #IndianVariant
1	@Qweeniesworld_ In areas with high vaccination rates, new cases are dropping. The vaccines are proven safe and proven to help protect against COVID
1	So happy when I got my 1st COVID vaccine. Waiting for my 2nd is hard! Let's get our vaccinations folks so we can our world opened up again! #PfizerVaccine  #GetVaccinated  #VaccinesWork  https://t.co/7fsnNNnf5w
1	the most successful thing i’ve achieved this year is having both of my covid vaccines
1	Celebrated my birthday by booking a Covid vaccine. What a day.
1	@HStarshot We have funded the COVID-19 vaccine development and I’m grateful for that.
1	I get my second dose of the covid vaccine in 3 days and I’m very excited
1	@tonyposnanski Not getting Covid is a plus too. I had it in October. I would cough so hard I would pass out. I would let them stab me in the eye with a vaccine not to have that again.
1	@orlandosentinel Today I tested positive with COVID and I was fully vaccinated with Pfizer back in Jan 20, 2021. So much for the cdc telling people that it is safe to resume to normal life by removing our masks.  Luckily my symptoms are tolerable, probably in a part to the vaccine.
1	Day 5 of the vaccine: cough, headache and body aches like crazy  Still better than what could happen if I actually had covid so I’ll take it
1	Both my parents recovered from COVID and are doing well. They received first dose of the vaccine and it protected them. But many aren't that lucky. We lost 4 members in our immediate and extended families. A cousin got tocilizumab on the black market but couldn't save his mother.
1	I’m so excited that my 12 year old nephew got his first #CovidVaccine shot this weekend! #Vaccination is good science!
1	I believe COVID vaccines work and:  “If we knew we could eliminate indoor rules when cases go down to a certain level and vaccinations reach a certain percentage of the population, people would better understand rules they were asked to follow.”  https://t.co/OhaTIfngGi
1	finally booked for my first dose of a COVID vaccine! not sure which one i'm getting yet, but i'll found out on Tuesday! super duper stoked.
1	I just watched a video from a doctor that said catching covid can make men lose their ability to get a boner so he said stay masked up and get the vaccine LOL😭
0	I didn’t even feel this bad when I had actual Covid! The vaccine has done me over 😥
0	@DrSenthil_MDRD Anyone gave me an evidence for COVID Vaccinations won't affect humans..? Any authenticated reports given by govt..? Any RTIs ? I'm not against allopathic or vaccinations, but since we don't have any  single Evidence from a govt that covid vaccines are safe..? So this too unproven
0	Has anyone had the J&amp;J covid vaccine? Just wondering how long I should expect to have these side effects for? 🥴 it’s been over 24 hours and I’m still extremely lethargic
0	this covid vaccine’s kicking me in the ass rn
0	@CP24 Funny how police are not enforcing COVID-19 restrictions on these protesters. Which proves again that COVID-19 is fake and taking the vaccine is not needed unless you're trying to commit suicide!  #FakePandemic
0	This is incredibly worrisome. Over 3000 deaths in 4 months in Texas alone from Covid vaccines.  https://t.co/PbvkXgonZc
0	The COVID-19 vaccine will save lives.   Will it? NO.  https://t.co/JRNF3beuR5
0	THE COVID VACCINE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN IF WE DON'T KNOW ITS CONTENTS:  @christo96125424 Horrors of the tuskegee genocide has never been truly told. Blk mothers who was pregnant, was giving arsenic, cyanide, study their reaction. 100% fatal . The genocide inside the genocide.
0	Wake the fuck up!  You are taking a vaccine that only lessons the effects of Covid.   It does not protect you against getting Covid.  You own immunities will protect you 99%.  https://t.co/mDaWROKF1D
0	If the Covid-19 vaccines are so effective and safe, why would the govt. force them on citizens, whether by issuing so called "vaccination passports" which would be required to travel and attend public events, or by offering money to get vaccinated?  Something smells fishy.
0	DON'T TAKE THE JAB 🎯  @CDCgov released the latest deaths following the experimental COVID-19 vaccine, and that death toll now stands at 4,434 people, adults and children, that have died after receiving the coronavirus shot.  🇺🇸  https://t.co/YmrXX99fl9 🇺🇸  https://t.co/p0JiJo6i2G
0	So many people getting covid regardless of them having the full vaccine... so what’s the point to the vaccine if you’re still going to get the virus even though you’re healthy enough to not die/get really sick from it ? Makes zero sense
0	57 Top Scientists And Doctors Release Shocking Study On COVID Vaccines And Demand Immediate Stop to ALL Vaccinations  https://t.co/HDoZkihY5A via @Prepare For Change
0	If you don't take your covid-19 vaccine  How will you be tracked by satellite?
0	You can’t have your brows or hair dyed or get Botox within 2 weeks of the jab due to reactions. Sorry, why would a vaccine for a respiratory illness cause adverse reactions that are nothing to do with Covid?  Yet STILL people are accepting these things as perfectly safe? 🤷🏻‍♀️
